What is routing:
1. So we can give navigations in our app
2. We can pass some data using URLS
3. We can have secure areas.

How:
1. import RouterModule
2. use forRoot method to provide multiple URLS.
3. dont miss to place  <router-outlet></router-outlet> on root components html
4. routerLink to give links 
5. { path: '', redirectTo: 'employee', pathMatch: 'full' } for default view.

For dynamic routes we can use url/:key , key will be replaced with value.

To read the URL data.
ActivatedRoute service will be used.

Router servic willbe used to navigate from typescript.
