What is routing:
1. So we can give navigations in our app
2. We can pass some data using URLS
3. We can have secure areas.

How:
1. import RouterModule
2. use forRoot method to provide multiple URLS.
3. dont miss to place  <router-outlet></router-outlet> on root components html
4. routerLink to give links 
5. { path: '', redirectTo: 'employee', pathMatch: 'full' } for default view.

For dynamic routes we can use url/:key , key will be replaced with value.

To read the URL data.
ActivatedRoute service will be used.

Router servic willbe used to navigate from typescript.

Guards:
To authorize if user has access to a route.
To prefetch the data.


How:
1. ng g guard <guard_nam>

Types of guards:
1. canActivate:
To restrict the access to routes.
2. canActivateChild
To restrict access to child routes.
3. CanDeactivate :
To check if we can move away from the route.
4. Resolve Guards:
To prefetch the data.
To use session:

Lazy Loading:
What:
On demand loading.

types:
1. Lazy
2. Eager

Steps to implement:
1. We should have a feature modules.
2. It should not be part of imports array of any other module.
3. It should not share anything with other modules.
4. For routing the parent route path should be set to blank in feature module.
5. Add a routing configuration in routing module.

NOTE: Least used module should be lazy loaded.
