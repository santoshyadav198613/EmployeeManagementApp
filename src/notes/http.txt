Why:
1. In realtime apps, we need to interact with API to get, post thee data.
2. Http service will help us to achieve the same.

Restfull:
1. get
2. post
3. put
4. delete
5. jsonp


How:
1. import the http module import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';.
2. 


Observable:
it comes from rxjs library, and it is proposed feature for ES7.
it uses Publish and Subsribe pattern.
it also gives us data in streams.


Interceptor:
1. Changing or modifying the http request.

How :

1. implement HttpInterceptor interface.
2. register { provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass: HttpInterceptorService, multi: true }
3. here multi true means this provider has array of services and we are
adding our service to existing list.
