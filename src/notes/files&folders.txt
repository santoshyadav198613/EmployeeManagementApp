It basically adds some extra functionality to our class.

impots array.

4. bootstrap: it will be our root/entry component.

Component:
1. Code reusability.
2. HTML tags.
3. Has view/template and its metadata.

Angulr CLI creates 4 files for each Component.
1. <component_name>.component.css -- css classes
2. <component_name>.component.html -- our template
3. <component_name>.component.spec.ts -- Unit Test case file
4. <component_name>.component.ts -- metadata for component.
